#  Airfare Price Prediction using Machine Learning

This project aims to predict airline ticket prices using machine learning algorithms, enabling customers to make **cost-effective and informed travel decisions**. By accurately forecasting airfare trends based on multiple factors like date, time, airline, stops, and routes, customers can plan their trips in a way that saves money and avoids unexpected price hikes.
